Hey there. _This_ is the first post.

This is the second paragraph. Here is a [link to our sponsor][1].

This is a <code>code tag</code>. I also want inline code done `via backticks` like in [Stack Overflow][2]. _freaking awesome_. Here's some preformatted code with a C# brush:

<pre class="brush: c#;">
public class Foo : IBar
{
	public void SayHello()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
	}
}
</pre>

Testing preformatted code via indentation:

    foo.bar = function(callback) {
			callback();
		};

Hmm. Not as much control over tabs but it works.

Unordered list:

- foo
- bar

Ordered list:

1. One
2. Two

OK, email style citations:

> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
